# React with Styled Components V5

Using styled components is really straight forward but it can be quite confusing at time.
To make it easier I've put together this project that you are free to use on your own projects.
There is no logic in regards to registering and account but the goal was to create a mobile first design.

- This project has the following
  - Toggling of light and dark mode
  - Hamburger display that is using custom css
  - Routing via `react-router-dom`

## Toggling, Gradient Layout & Responsive Design (Requirements)

All of the code in this repos will help you get comfortable with using styled components within a React Project. You can go ahead and clone this project.

The project is passing accessibility contrast and other initial checks when using Deque (AxeDeque) extensions when running an accessibility check on a site.

To see what packages are needed look at the `package.json` file that will tell you what is needed for the end result of the deployed project.
